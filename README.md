# music_downloader

A Java application that provides an interface to download songs, albums or playlists.
Songs are downloaded from Youtube and metadata are automatically applied

The music download part is done by ritiek's spotify-downloader : https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader

/!\ You have to download the application from the ritiek's repo (couldn't find how to include it in my app :'(.
You can do it thanks to the command : `pip install spotdl` (python and pip necessary)


/!\ You also need ffmpeg for encoding : `pip install ffmpeg`


*The application is only an GUI.*
*You need Python and Java installed to run the app*
